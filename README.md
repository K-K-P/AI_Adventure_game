# AI_Adventure_game
ChatGPT-powered AI game generator. Utilizes Cassandra vector DB 

This application allows us to create a text game which is utilizing the idea of LLM, e.g. OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Prompt template (here prompt_template.txt) is a hint and the first input that we are providing to the model. 
Based on these information, the model starts the game and creates its logic. 

Whole application is built based on Cassandra vector DB for some educational purposes. The core idea of this project
is to take a closer look to ML-aimed vector DB and - so called - "prompt engineering" - all of this wrapped with Python code.
